<p>
  Hey there! I used to sell things, but now I build things with computer code! <br /> I love using my creativity to come up with cool new ideas and solve tricky problems.

<p>As a self taught developer, I think it's super fun and exciting to learn new things every day,<br /> plus I get to work with awesome people and be part of cool projects.

<p>If you need someone who's passionate, creative, and knows how to sell AND code, I'm your gal! Let's build something great together!</p>
